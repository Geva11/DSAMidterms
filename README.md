# **What is React JS?**

## **React JS** 
- is a popular JavaScript Library for building user interfaces. It's known for its component-based architecture, which makes it easier to create complex, interactive UIs. By breaking down UIs into smaller, reusable components, React promotes code reusability, maintainability, and efficient updates.

### *Key Features of React JS:*
- **Component-Based Architecture:** This allows you to build UIs as a collection of independent components, each with its own logic and rendering.

- **JSX:** A syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like structures within JavaScript code, making it more intuitive to build UIs.

- **Virtual DOM:** React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the actual DOM, leading to better performance.

- **Uninderectional Data Flow:** Data flows in one direction, making it easier to reason about and debug applications.

# **How to set up React JS?**

## **Basic Guide for setting up React JS**

### 1. Install Node.js and npm(or yarn)
- Download Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en
- To verify the installation:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### 2. Install Code Editor
- You can download great code editor like Visual Code Studio as recommendation for React Development, here's the link: https://code.visualstudio.com/

### 3. Create a New React Project
- Open your terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the desired directory.
- Run the following command to create a new React app:
```bash
npx create-react-app my-first-react-app
```

### 4. Start the Development Server
- Navigate into the project directory:
```bash
cd my-first-react-app
```
- Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```
This will open a new browser tab with your React app running.
